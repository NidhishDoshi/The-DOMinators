### Important Notice Regarding Usage of Free Hosting Services
•Due to the use of free hosting services, there might be instances when our allocated usage quota is exhausted, resulting in a temporary inability to connect to the database. Should this occur, please contact our team immediately. We will promptly restore the database using alternative credentials.<br/>
Please be aware that when we switch to a new free hosting service, all existing user data will be lost.<br/>
•Free hosting services may occasionally limit the number of concurrent connections, which can prevent access to the database. If you encounter this issue, please try again after some time.<br/>
